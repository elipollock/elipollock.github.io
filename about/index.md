## Bio
I grew up outside Philadelphia, and studied physics and biophysics at UPenn during undergrad. After that I came to MIT to study neuroscience in the [Brain and Cognitive Sciences Department](https://bcs.mit.edu/).

My research in the Jazayeri lab focuses on understanding cognitive processes through the emergent dynamics of recurrent neural networks.

Other interests include running, playing music, and learning Chinese. I'm also involved with the [MIT Science Policy Initiative](https://mitspi.squarespace.com/).
