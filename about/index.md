## Bio
I grew up outside Philadelphia, and studied physics and biophysics at UPenn during undergrad. After that I came to MIT to study neuroscience in the [Brain and Cognitive Sciences Department](https://bcs.mit.edu/).

My research in the [Jazayeri lab](https://www.jazlab.org), a part of the [McGovern Institute for Brain Research](https://mcgovern.mit.edu/), focuses on understanding cognitive processes through the emergent dynamics of recurrent neural networks.

Other interests include running, music, travel, and learning Chinese. I'm also involved with the [MIT Science Policy Initiative](https://mitspi.squarespace.com/).
