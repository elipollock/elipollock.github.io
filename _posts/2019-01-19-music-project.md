Although I haven't done it in a while, I used to dabble in writing/arranging/music. I play French horn, trumpet, piano, ukulele, bass guitar, and piano (to varying degrees of ability) as well as sing, so other than artificially creating drum sounds I recorded all of the parts myself. Here's my [soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/eli-pollock) if you want to check any of it out!


Also, I have [footage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYW8hCL5jKk) of me peaking in high school.
