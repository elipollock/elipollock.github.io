Here's my first post on this site. I've built it using the [Moon theme](https://taylantatli.github.io/Moon/moon-theme/) for Jekyll, and published it using [Github pages](https://pages.github.com/). You can read more about the process for getting it set up on the "Projects" page, since getting it set up was itself a bit of a project.

More to the point, I'm hoping to use this site as a central location for my digital presence. You can expect to find a CV, some of my social media accounts, links to various projects or publications, and a little bit of information about me.
