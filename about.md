I grew up outside Philadelphia, and studied physics and biophysics at UPenn during undergrad. After that I came to MIT to study computational neuroscience, and my work focused on interpretability of recurrent neural network models. 

Right out of grad school in 2022, I co-founded a startup called Ontologic that built a data platform for scientists, first in academic neuroscience and eventually in biotech. This was a huge learning experience for me. My daily work could range from onboarding new bioinformatics tools to the platform to brainstorming multi-cloud architectures with our engineers to doing sales prospecting and taking customer discovery calls. I learned about product management, project management, and perhaps most importantly people management. It didn't work out in the end, but I enjoyed the journey and am excited for whatever comes next.

Outside of work, I enjoy exercising at my local Crossfit gym, where I'm also an L1-certified coach. I like to travel, read, and make music when I have the time. I live in Somerville, MA, and have a desk at [Industry Lab](https://www.industrylab.com) nearby in Cambridge.
