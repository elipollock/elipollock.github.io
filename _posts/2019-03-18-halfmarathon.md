In 2018, I had the goal of running 500 miles. I've been running on and off since 2012, and have done a few 5k races in that time. For a variety of reasons, I wanted to get a little more serious about running. I ended up achieving my total mile goal, and over the course of the year I ran the BAA 10k as well as the [BAA Half Marathon](https://www.baa.org/races/baa-half-marathon). My time for the latter was 1:42:12, which I was very happy with given that I had never run a half marathon before.

I really like the half marathon. It's challenging enough that it requires training and feels like an accomplishment, but it doesn't come with the same health risks of a full marathon (like short-term acute kidney damage). I've signed up for the [Boston Run to Remember](https://www.bostonsruntoremember.org/) race, with the goal of breaking 100 minutes. It's now "training season," so I'll be posting some aspects of my training here. This isn't going to be a definitive guide to preparing, but it will at least be a place for me to share some things that I've learned about running.

## Routes around Cambridge/Boston

I've always been a map nerd, so I love creating running routes. I use the free tool from [On The Go Map](https://onthegomap.com/#/create), which uses open-source map data. Since I live near Inman Square, most of my routes start and end there, but there are some that start and end from the gym at MIT where I sometimes work out.


### 7-miler

Nice run with a few hills on Cambridge Street, but mostly on the beautiful flat path that goes along the Charles River. Great views of the Boston skyline as well a nice pass through Harvard Yard.

Extends the 7 mile run to cross over to Boston, going down the Esplanade and then crossing back.

### 10-miler

Including a foray into Back Bay along the Commonwealth Ave Mall to the statue of William Lloyd Garrison. I also found a small way to extend the path in Cambridgeport so that it goes away from the road and closer to the river.

## Running Schedule

Here is a table showing my schedule for running. I only gave myself 11 weeks to train this time; 12 probably would have been better but I fractured my elbow and was then traveling. This schedule is meant to be mostly a guideline, as there's always a chance that somethingg will come up that requires me to delay, shorten, or even skip a run. The main idea is to run 4 times a week, include some kind of speed training on one of those days, have one "long run" over the weekend, and do at least two 13.1-mile runs. The "speed training" consists of running 4 1-mile intervals at a fast pace. These are marked as "4x1" in the table below. Otherwise, numbers indicate how long a run on that day should be.

| Week | M | T | W   | T | F | S       | S                |

## Diet
I don't really have a "training diet," as I try to eat healthy all the time. I'm fairly flexible when it comes to what I eat, and as a grad student I'm always on the lookout for free food, but I usually stick to the following when I'm feeding myself. Maybe the most idiosyncratic thing about what I eat is the fact that I'd what you might call a humaneitarian. This means I try to only eat meat if I know that it comes from an animal that was humanely raised, ideally in an environmentally sustainable way. As a result, I pay more for meat but tend to eat less of it.

### Breakfast
I eat pretty much the same breakfast every day. Occasionally I'll do something crazy like buy a bunch of bagels to eat for the week, but my "standard fare" is below. For breakfast, I like to get a decent amount of protein and fat.
- Fage Plain 5% Greek Yogurt
- Frozen mixed berries
- Ground flax
- Mixed raw or dry-roasted nuts (cashews, almonds, walnuts, Brazil nuts, pecans, etc)
- Dried coconut flakes
- A cup of coffee brewed from freshly-ground, high-quality beans.

### Lunch
This depends on the week, as I do like to have at least a little variety in what I eat. I typically don't eat meat for lunch anymore, mainly for environmental reasons. The general formula is as follows:
- Some kind of pulse (lentils, beans, etc) or a high-protein grain (bulgur wheat, quinoa, etc)
- Various roasted or sauteed vegetables (onions, peppers, squash, brussel sprouts, eggplant, tomato, etc)
- Some cheese and carrots. This is something I used to have as a kid and have internalized as a Good Thing To Have For Lunch.
- Chips. I love the Terra blue potato chips that are served on JetBlue planes and can get big bags of them at my supermarket. But I'll take whatever. I tend towards less-processed chips, avoiding things that have sugar snuck into them.

I also like to have a bit of dark chocolate with an espresso during the afternoon. The darker the better.

### Dinner
Much like with breakfast, I don't like to think too much about what I'm having for dinner, beyond picking different types of meat.
- Meat, sustainably and ethically sourced (local, grass-fed, free-range, and all that good stuff)
- An egg or two if I've exercised that day.
- Salad greens, with your choice of dressing (simple olive oil and vinegar is ideal). Maybe with olives?
- Corn chips with melted cheese on them (i.e. very basic nachos). Can be substituted with some other carb/cheese combo.
- Dessert: an apple with peanut butter.
