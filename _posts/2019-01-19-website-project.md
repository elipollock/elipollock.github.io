Partly because I want to start filling up the "projects" list on this site, but mostly because I felt like I've learned a lot in creating this site, I'm going to explain exactly how this site was made. There are a few steps to creating a personal website, and I'll do my best to explain how I arrived at the decisions I made and what I did to make it work. This will be written from the perspective of someone who knows next to nothing about web development.

They are as follows: 
- Getting a domain name
- Choosing a hosting/building service for your site
- Using GitHub Pages and Jekyll to make a nice-looking site

## Domain names
You don't *have* to buy a domain name if you don't mind having a site that ends in .github.io. Personally, I wanted to have a website at my very own domain name.

There are many places to buy a domain name, and many types of domains! The most common is of course .com, and other familiar ones like .org or .net. There are also many country-code domains, some of which are extremely popular for [domain hacking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_hack) and therefore much more expensive. If you have a name for your site that lends itself very well to such a trick, you should absolutely go for it. I went with a boring old .com domain.

However, keep in mind that not every service selling domain names supports all of them. I purchased mine through [Google Domains](domains.google.com), which was cheap but fairly limited in which kinds of domains you can buy. I got mine for $12 a year. Based on the reviews I read, it looks like Google is great for both price and simplicity. Many other services, like BlueHost or iPage, will bundle a "free domain name" with a website editor, but are much more expensive. More on that in...

## Hosting and building
Choosing between services for hosting and building your first website is like [trying to buy something from a Kumail Nanjiani character in a Portlandia sketch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4dcwCgv3ME). All of the options are roughly similar, but there are numerous hidden costs for things whose value you don't really know (do I need extra that extra security service? I don't know!). Although the prices as advertised seemed quite low for both BlueHost and iPage, I couldn't quite stomach the full cost when faced with the checkout pages (on the order of hundreds of dollars for multi-year plans). Sure, I'd love to have a what-you-see-if-what-you-get editor, but I also like to save money. So I decided to go with what a friend of mine did and use [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/), which hosts your site for FREE and lets you build it for free as well. The only downside is that it requires a little more tinkering under the hood to get it that way. Which brings us to...

## Building a GitHub Pages site with Jekyll
The homepage of GitHub Pages is really nice. There's a friendly video showing you the basics of how to get set up, and even step-by-step instructions that allow you to get your site set up in minutes! I was feeling like a Real HackerÂ®. Even if you've never used git or GitHub before (and my own experience is fairly limited), it's very easy. 

However, then the tutorial ends, and there are links at the bottom of the page to further documentation on using Jekyll. Unfortunately, these are full of semi-redundant links to pages that link to other pages, creating a labyrinth of docs and leading the user to open far too many tabs than is good for their sanity. What to do?

### Keep calm and browse some themes
For the moment, don't worry about downloading Jekyll to your local machine. A good place to start is choosing a nice-looking Jekyll theme for your site. This will determine the general aesthetic of your site. There are a couple ways to do this:
1) You can use the Jekyll theme chooser on GitHub. By going into your repo settings, you can choose from a small number of themes. This is very easy, but you still have to customize it with your content. Additionally, your choices are very limited, so you might not find a theme that suits your needs. I decided not to go with this option.
2) You can use an open-source [Jekyll theme](http://jekyllthemes.org/), made by some friendly stranger! There are tons of themes on the site I linked to there, so you're bound to find something right for you. I went with the [Moon theme](https://github.com/TaylanTatli/Moon).

Many of the custom themes have instructions for how to customize them for your own use. Most involve just copying the repository into your own website and editing all of the relevant content and configuration files. There are also some instructions on GitHub for customizing your themes by overriding specific files, but this seems to require knowing how to use Jekyll and understanding which files to change. If you're a noob like me, it's probably best to just download the whole repository for your theme.

### Editing your site
If you want to edit a bunch of files or add pictures on your local computer, you can do so and then use the following commands (assuming you've set up a git repo for your website and have a git-enabled command window open):
```
cd /path/to/website.github.io # Go to your repo
git add . # This tells git to "stage" all the files you've changed
git commit -m "insert message"  # Now you commit the changes to the local repo. The -m tag allows you to write a short message about what you changed in the commit.
git push origin master  # This adds your changes to the version hosted by GitHub. In a minute or two, your site should update!
```
You can also use the GitHub Desktop app if you have a fear of the command line. Or, you can directly edit the repo on GitHub!
